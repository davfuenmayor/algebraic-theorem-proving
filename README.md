# Algebraic Theorem Proving
Algebraic techniques for theorem proving in non-classical (many-valued &amp; modal) logics, with the aim of integrating computer algebra systems (currently SageMath).

### Beware: Work in progress!
This early-stage work seeks to implement the [Polynomial Ring Calculus](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1423156) approach.
